**Story**
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon (berry) tree, which was on the banks of a river,
there lived a Crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruit. The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends. One day monkey sent some fruits for crocodile's wife.
She ate the food and liked them, but was jealous, as she didn't like her husband spending time with the monkey. She
told her husband, "If the fruits are so juicy, I wonder how sweet monkey's heart would be. Get the heart of the monkey." The crocodile was not
willing to kill his friend, but had no choice.
